# Recommendations for Engineers
All of my recommendations for aspiring engineers in a single place, coming from various areas of interest. The principal scope supports `data science`, `programming`, `python`, `math`, `cybersecurity`, `business`, and `productivity`.

The list also aggregates and extends most of the suggestions from [my blog posts](https://pawelcislo.com/), where some of the entries come from a different language (🇵🇱). Although it's my personal list, don't hesitate to create a pull request if I missed something interesting or if there is a dead link.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
